# EcoFurni Project

Welcome to the EcoFurni project repository! 

## Overview
EcoFurni is a sustainable initiative aimed at addressing the challenge of managing unwanted furniture and debris by providing a platform for users to list, refurbish, and repurpose old items. Our goal is to promote sustainability, reduce environmental impact, and foster community engagement.

## Features
- **Listing Platform**: Users can list their old furniture and tech items for refurbishment or repurposing.
- **Generative AI Descriptions**: Dynamic generation of catchy descriptions for listed items using OpenAI's generative AI technology.
- **Gamification**: Users earn points for listing, selling, and buying items, with rewards for reaching certain point thresholds.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage with local communities and stakeholders to understand their needs and concerns regarding furniture and tech recycling.
